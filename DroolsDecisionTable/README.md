The Rule Engines make it easy to separate the business logic from the code.
We can see the rule engines as a sophisticated if/then statement. 

# Advantages of rule engines in Java:

1.The rule engines provide great reusability when we keep them separate.
2.The rule engines reduce the complexity because we donâ€™t need to develop the source code.
3.The rule engines provide flexibility where we can change the rules without changing anything in the source code.
